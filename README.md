js-camera-filters
=================

This website uses javascript to access your camera
and applies edge detection matrices in realtime.

Supported filters are
- Gaussian blur
- Prewitt X/Y
- Sobel X/Y
- Kirsh X/Y
- LaPlace

You can define your own filtering matrices as well.
Many thanks to [Martin Thoma](http://martin-thoma.com/) from whom the idea and template originated.
